        <h1>The use of Data Science with social media</h1>
        Over the past few years, many people have had growing concerns for their privacy and the threat online media platforms have to it.
        People question the ethics of collecting user information and building profiles of data using it,
        and it is for this reason that there is an ethical discussion to be had in what kinds
        of data Data Scientists should and shouldn't process.
        <br class="med-space">
        Here are some regulations protecting the data and privacy of users;
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>
                <p>- This regulation protects a European's data from any company in the world, for as long as that company sells anything to any European citizen.</p>
                <p>- Considered the most strict privacy act in the world.</p>
                <p>- Made effective May 25, 2018.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa">Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA)</a>
                <p>- Protects children aged under 13</p>
                <p>- Provents any tracking of children without parent's consent</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How can I help advance the field while remaining ethical?</h3>
        - Contribute your own data willingly to projects that are open! Use open projects (AI, etc) like <a href="https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>
        - Avoid collecting data when possible. And, when you need data, try to make that data anonymous; remove any identifiers when they're not needed.
